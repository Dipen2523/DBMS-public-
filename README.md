# Database Management Systems (DBMS) Basics

## Introduction

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. It provides an interface for users to interact with the database and manage data efficiently.

## Types of Databases

### Relational Databases (RDBMS)

- **Definition:** Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, and establishes relationships between them using keys.
- **Example:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server.

### NoSQL Databases

- **Definition:** Stores and retrieves data in a non-tabular format, often using JSON-like documents or key-value pairs.
- **Example:** MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.

### NewSQL Databases

- **Definition:** Combines the scalability of NoSQL systems with the ACID guarantees of traditional RDBMS.
- **Example:** Google Spanner, CockroachDB.

## Common Tools

- **MySQL Workbench:** A visual database design tool and administration tool for MySQL.
- **pgAdmin:** A web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL.
- **MongoDB Compass:** A GUI for MongoDB.
- **Redis Desktop Manager:** A GUI for managing Redis databases.
- **SQLiteStudio:** A visual tool for SQLite databases.

## Basic Concepts

- **Data:** Raw facts and figures that have no meaning unless processed.
- **Information:** Processed and structured data that provides context and meaning.
- **Database:** A structured collection of data stored in a computer, organized for efficient retrieval.
- **Table:** A collection of related data organized in rows and columns.
- **Query:** A request for information from a database.
- **Schema:** A blueprint of how the database is constructed, including tables, fields, and relationships.

1. **What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?**
   - *Definition:* A software system that allows users to interact with databases by storing, retrieving, and managing data efficiently.

2. **What is the difference between a database and a DBMS?**
   - *Answer:* A database is a structured collection of data, while a DBMS is a software system that manages this data.

3. **What is SQL?**
   - *Answer:* SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

4. **What is normalization?**
   - *Answer:* Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency.

5. **What is ACID in the context of databases?**
   - *Answer:* ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably.

6. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**
   - *Answer:* SQL databases are relational and use structured query language, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and use various data models like document, key-value, or graph.

7. **What are indexes in databases?**
   - *Answer:* Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional space and decreased performance on write operations.

8. **Explain the concept of a primary key.**
   - *Answer:* A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identified.

9. **What is a foreign key?**
   - *Answer:* A foreign key is a field in a database table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.

10. **What is data integrity?**
    - *Answer:* Data integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data in a database.
