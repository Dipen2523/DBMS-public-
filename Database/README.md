# What is a Database?

A **Data Base** is an Organized Collection of Data which can be easily
accessed, managed and updated.
In today’s World, Data plays a vital role in every business. In our day to day life, we see or
interact with many applications and Software’s, every application that we see or work with will
have two parts:

1. GUI (Graphical User Interface / Front end)
2. Database

To keep it simple GUI is the part where user interacts with (like Facebook applications – look
and feel) and the Data that we see in the application (like Facebook profile, messages, images
and videos) are pulled from Database.


End User who interacts with the application may not know how the data is being fetched and
where so much of information is stored. Internally all the dynamic content that we see in the
application is fetched from Database.

Database and all its components should be designed and configured at the time of application
development. Once the application is developed we will not be able to make changes to the
database structure as every change will hugely affect the business application GUI code.
It is very important to make sure that data is securely maintained and accurately stored. 

So to maintain security and accuracy in database a set of rules / software system is defined and that
we call it as DBMS (Data Base Management System – which performs all the operations on the
database)

## What is DBMS?

**DBMS** (Database Management System) is a software tool that is used to store and manage data
in the Database.

A database management system contains a set of programs that control the creation,
maintenance, and use of a database. Like:

- Adding new data to the table.
- Modifying existing data.
- Deleting unwanted data.

DBMS allows different user application programs to concurrently access the same database.
Before Database and DBMS were introduced, traditional approach was to store data in flat files
(physical files in system) but there were some disadvantages with it.

## What is RDBMS?

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a Database Management System
(DBMS) that is based on the relational model introduced by E. F. Codd and most popular 
databases currently in use are based on the relational database model. To put in different 
words RDBMS is built on top of in which data is stored in tables and the relationships among 
the data are maintained. The data stored in a table is organized into rows and columns. Each 
row in a table represents an individual record and each column represents a field. A record is 
an individual entry in the database.
